I designed my finite automata to have all possible states. 
Beacuse this was so much code I wrote my automata into different classes named graphs. But they are all connected and they are the same finite automata.

To compile:

g++ -std=c++11 PasswordAutomata.h PasswordAutomata.cpp main.cpp

Then:
	./a.out
